# ScryHub




## Terms

* `LGSLibrary` - a chrome extension that hosts 1 to many `LGSProviders`
* `LGSProvider` - a class/function that can lookup card information from a defined store (your Local Game Store for example)


## TODOS

- update docs with new terminology
- figure out publishing
- update the sample project
- talk about possibly the `provider: { key, lookup } ` interface for implementers
- Add toggle for scryhub to be active or not
